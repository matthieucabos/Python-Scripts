All these Scripts have been written by myself, some of theme are associated to a Shell Script. Must be used on a Linux OS or similar with a corresponding network structure.

The structure of the network is essentially ruled by the ssh dictionnaries, the structure of ods files and the Socket Description Convention. 

Update them will allow to use these script with an other network.
